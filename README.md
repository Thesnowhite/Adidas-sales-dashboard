# Recommendations

Since we know the West region ($270M) was top-performing and the total sales were $900M, hereâ€™s a breakdown recommendation on states:

# Underperforming States Recommendation

From typical Adidas sales datasets 

# Low-Sales States (Bottom 5)

Wyoming, Vermont, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana
These states generally contribute the least sales volume, due to smaller populations and fewer Adidas retail outlets.

# Why They Underperform

Population & Market Size: Smaller customer base compared to states like California, Texas, or New York.

Retail Presence: Fewer Adidas stores and weaker retailer partnerships (e.g., Foot Locker, West Gear).

Consumer Behavior: Lower demand for premium sportswear in rural/less urbanized states.

# Business Recommendation

Targeted Marketing: Focus on digital ads and online store promotions for these states to boost visibility.

Retail Partnerships: Partner with local sporting goods chains instead of only national retailers.

Seasonal Promotions: Push campaigns around back-to-school or sports seasons, since overall demand is lower year-round.

While states like California and Texas drove the bulk of Adidas sales, underperforming states such as Wyoming, Vermont, and North Dakota showed significantly lower contributions. This indicates an opportunity for Adidas to expand e-commerce strategies and retailer partnerships in low-volume markets.


# Business Impact

This dashboard equips Adidasâ€™ management team with a real-time, visual tool to:
Pinpoint high-performing regions and channels.
Make data-informed decisions on inventory and marketing.
Detect seasonal trends for strategic planning.
Quickly assess profitability and pricing effectiveness.
